Challenge #1

A 3-tier environment is a common setup. Use a tool of your choosing/familiarity create these resources. Please remember we will not be judged on the outcome but more focusing on the approach, style and reproducibility.
 
Solution:

Instead of choosing convention way of hosting 3 tier application using web server , RDS and LoadBalancer.I have used serverless services for hosting this.
This approach is cost efficient.

 i. Front end : For front end, I am using api gateway
 ii. APplication End: Hosted sample python code 
 iii. Created s3 bucket to store the output of Lambda
 
 Frontend(Api Gateway) will trigger Lambda where our application is hosted. Lambda have logic to copy a file from one s3 bucket to another.
 Finally data layer is nothing but s3.
