Challenge #3

We have a nested object, we would like a function that you pass in the object and a key and get back the value. How this is implemented is up to you.
Example Inputs
object = {“a”:{“b”:{“c”:”d”}}}
key = a/b/c
object = {“x”:{“y”:{“z”:”a”}}}
key = x/y/z
value = a
Hints:
We would like to see some tests. A quick read to help you along the way
We would expect it in any other language apart from elixir.

Once this has been completed please send us the output so we can get the ball rolling.
 
             Solution: 
            
             # Online Python compiler (interpreter) to run Python online.
# Write Python 3 code in this online editor and run it.
print("Hello world")

def nested_get(input_dict, nested_key):
    internal_dict_value = input_dict
    for k in nested_key:
        internal_dict_value = internal_dict_value.get(k, None)
        if internal_dict_value is None:
            return None
    return internal_dict_value
    

print(nested_get({"a":{"b":{"c":1}}},["a","b","c"]))
